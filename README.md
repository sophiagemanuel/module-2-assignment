Module Two Assignment
For module two assignment, I created a code in which I created columns for three sheets of information for ticker symbols, total stock volume, yearly change, and percent change.
I calculated the greatest percentage increase, the greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume. 
I made sure they looped throughout the worksheet by using the For Each ws in Worksheets command. 
For majority of the commands, I created it by looking through the zoom lectures and class assignments in order to create our code, for the code that I created that I needed additional help for, here are the resources:
